# Championship Manager Style Football Results

Football league table and results webpage made using vue.js and results from the football-data.org api.

To work on my CSS I decided to style it to look like Championship Manager:

## Still to do:

- Make CSS more responsive.
- Update the buttons on the left with the most recently selected team & player and make clickable.
- I would like to do more with the matches but have reached the limit of information on the free tier of the api.
- Change background and have a selection.
